        ***GUIDE TO THIS SCRIPT***

        This script is responsible for setting up new MySQL Cluster SQL nodes.

        SQL node creation will involve some or all of the following actions, depending upon the
        state of the SQL node:

        - The creation of the SPF database (created the first time this script is ever executed).

        - The creation and population of the SPF base tables (created once per cluster i.e. the first
          time this script is ever executed).

        - The creation of SPF views (created on each SQL node i.e. the first time this script is
          executed against a particular SQL node)

        - The creation of a user account on the new SQL node, which will also specify the node from
          which that user will connect. If there will be N SPF processes running on several nodes,
          all with the same user and each of which needs to connect to this SQL node, then this script
          will need to be executed N times).

        - The creation of a user account for replication on the new SQL node.

        - Replication user should be specified in the host config file for Master node.

        - Replication user should be same on both Master and Slave nodes.
